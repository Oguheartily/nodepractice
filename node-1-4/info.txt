Introduction 
When you have to run your Angular project or any ng command, you may see that the system shows the below error: 

ng: File C:\Users\admin\AppData\Roaming\npm\ng.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system. For more information, see about_Execution_Policies at https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170.

+ CategoryInfo : SecurityError: (:) [], PSSecurityException

+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : unauthorized access

Solution
This error occurs when your system has disabled the running script and your system is canâ€™t accept the ng commands. This error occurs due to security reasons and won't let the script be executed on your system without your approval. Then you have to open the PowerShell with administrative rights.

To solve this problem, you need to follow a few steps:

Step 1

First, you have to need to open the command prompt and run this command.

set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser


When you run this command, you can see that your system has set all policies for the current user as remotely. It will take few seconds to complete this process.
